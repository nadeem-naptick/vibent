- **5 Features**: Identified as high priority

## Priority-Based Implementation Roadmap

### üî• Phase 1: High Priority (Q1 2025)

#### 1. SDK Sessions Implementation
**Priority**: High ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "High Priority"
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks

**Current State**: Basic session storage but no proper SDK session management
**Implementation Plan**:
- Integrate Claude Code SDK session management
- Replace current sessionStorage with SDK sessions
- Add persistent conversation contexts
- Enable session recovery and restoration

**Benefits**:
- Better context retention across interactions
- Improved conversation continuity
- Session persistence and recovery

#### 2. Native Todo Tracking with Frontend Visibility
**Priority**: High ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "We should use native todo tracking from claude code sdk. This should be visible in the frontend as well so that users understand whats happening."
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

**Current State**: Custom TodoWrite tool implementation
**Implementation Plan**:
- Integrate SDK's native todo tracking system
- Create real-time frontend todo dashboard
- Show task progress to users during generation
- Add task completion notifications

**Benefits**:
- Better user transparency
- Native SDK integration
- Real-time progress visibility

#### 3. Sub-Agents for Application Mode
**Priority**: High ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "In application mode, we can enhance with sdk sub-agents.. lets implement this as high priority"
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

**Current State**: Basic Task tool with specialized agents
**Implementation Plan**:
- Implement SDK sub-agents for application mode
- Create specialized agents for different tech stacks
- Add agent orchestration for complex projects
- Enable parallel agent execution

**Benefits**:
- Better task specialization
- Improved application generation quality
- Parallel processing capabilities

#### 4. System Prompt Modification
**Priority**: High ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "Yes.. but lets plan this properly. We already have a static prompt in the application. How to implement this.. where would this be used and triggered.. Full fledge application should use their own prompt system instead of landing page prompt."
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks

**Current State**: Static prompts in generation API
**Implementation Plan**:
- **Landing Page Mode**: Keep simple static prompts
- **Application Mode**: Implement dynamic prompt system
  - Project type-based prompts (React, Node, etc.)
  - Context-aware prompts
  - User preference-based customization
- Add prompt template management
- Create prompt versioning system

**Benefits**:
- Better AI responses for different project types
- Customizable AI behavior
- Context-aware assistance

### ‚ö° Phase 2: Medium Priority (Q2 2025)

#### 5. Custom Tools + SDK Tools Integration
**Priority**: Medium ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "We should keep existing tools.. but add all Claude code sdk tools as well."
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks

**Implementation Plan**:
- Migrate existing custom tools to SDK system
- Add all available SDK tools
- Create hybrid tool management
- Maintain backward compatibility

#### 6. SDK Permissions System
**Priority**: Medium ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "Yes. we should"
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks

**Implementation Plan**:
- Implement permission-based tool access
- Add user role management
- Create security controls for tool usage
- Add audit logging

#### 7. Multi-Language Support (Node.js)
**Priority**: Medium ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "In Application mode, i dont want to limit this only to Vite or React.. we would need Node etc as well"
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks

**Implementation Plan**:
- Add Node.js project templates
- Support backend service generation
- Implement API development workflows
- Add microservices architecture support

#### 8. Streaming Optimization
**Priority**: Medium ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**User Feedback**: "I dont see why we would need Single Mode? Whats the use case.. we would be using streaming mode only.. unless you can think why would we need single mode"
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

**Implementation Plan**:
- Optimize current streaming performance
- Add optional single mode for:
  - Simple queries ("What does this code do?")
  - Cost optimization scenarios
  - Testing/debugging purposes
- Improve error handling in streaming

### üöÄ Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Q3-Q4 2025)

#### 9. Slash Commands
**Priority**: Low-Medium ‚≠ê
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- Quick command interface for productivity

#### 10. Cost Tracking Dashboard
**Priority**: Low-Medium ‚≠ê
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Resource management tools

#### 11. Enhanced Hooks System
**Priority**: Low ‚≠ê
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
- Better event handling and customization

### üìã Deferred/Low Priority

#### MCP Integration
**User Feedback**: "In later integration. Low priority for now"
**Status**: Deferred to 2026

#### Headless SDK
**User Feedback**: "We can plan this later only if its required."
**Status**: Plan if needed basis

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Considerations
1. **Dual Mode Support**: Maintain clear separation between Landing Page and Application modes
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality remains stable
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement features incrementally
4. **Performance**: Focus on streaming optimization and user experience

### Dependencies
- @anthropic-ai/claude-code: ^1.0.117 (already installed)
- ai-sdk-provider-claude-code: ^1.1.3 (already installed)
- Additional SDK packages as needed

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain fallback to existing systems
- Comprehensive testing for each phase
- User feedback collection at each milestone

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- [ ] SDK sessions reduce context loss by 80%
- [ ] Users can see real-time todo progress
- [ ] Sub-agents improve application quality scores
- [ ] Dynamic prompts increase user satisfaction

### Phase 2 Goals
- [ ] Tool integration maintains 100% backward compatibility
- [ ] Permission system reduces security concerns
- [ ] Node.js support expands use cases by 40%

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Phase 1 implementation starting with SDK Sessions
2. **Week 2**: Start native todo tracking frontend implementation
3. **Month 2**: Begin sub-agents development
4. **Month 3**: Start system prompt modification planning

## Conclusion

This implementation plan focuses on high-impact features that enhance the application mode experience while maintaining the simplicity of landing page mode. The phased approach ensures steady progress while minimizing risk to existing functionality.
